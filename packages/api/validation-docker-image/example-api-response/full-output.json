When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",

            "description": "Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",

When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",

            "description": "Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block\nis expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff888107e28800 (size 2048):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    b1 a6 7c 11 81 88 ff ff e0 5b b3 10 81 88 ff ff  ..|......[......\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 aa b0 84 ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab374e>] __kmalloc+0x4e/0x90\n    [<ffffffff832aec6d>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x34d/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n    [<ffffffff8379d29a>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x13a/0x1e0\n    [<ffffffff8379d50c>] __sys_sendmsg+0x11c/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff843b9ce0>] do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\nunreferenced object 0xffff88816d2c0400 (size 1024):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 57 f6 38 be 00 00 00 00  @.......W.8.....\n    10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff 10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff  ..,m......,m....\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab36c1>] __kmalloc_node+0x51/0x90\n    [<ffffffff81a8ed96>] kvmalloc_node+0xa6/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff82827d03>] bucket_table_alloc.isra.0+0x83/0x460\n    [<ffffffff82828d2b>] rhashtable_init+0x43b/0x7c0\n    [<ffffffff832aed48>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x428/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n\n[2]\n # tc qdisc add dev swp1 clsact\n # tc chain add dev swp1 ingress proto ip chain 1 flower dst_ip 0.0.0.0/32\n # tc qdisc del dev\n---truncated---",

This is an ugly hack which can easily be backported\nto earlier kernels. A proper fix which cleans up the interfaces will\nfollow, but may not be so easy to backport.",

Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",

A simple curl to a HTTP\nbackend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large\npacket sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)\nwhile others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.\n\nIn fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the\nnode with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire\nfor the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been\n152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes\nwas padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we\nsaw user/payload data from prior processed packets).\n\nWe only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and\nthe backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request\ngot dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even\nthough the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to\nthe MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let\nthe curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the\npadding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).\n\nCommit e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") was too eager\nto also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd->len to rbi->len. It really needs\nto stick to rcd->len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.\nThe latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and\nit indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp->{data,data_end}\nparts. For e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") the\nrelevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the\nxdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp->frame_sz. With that fixed, traffic on\nthe wire looks good again.",

Ensure that\nchild_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within\ninherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the\ncleanup code.\n\nDetails:\n\nThere's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of\nmultiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not\na single regression.\n\nThe code initially incremented refcount then assigned context\nimmediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early\nvalidity check for child_event was added before the\nrefcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was\nadded, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.\nThe problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial\ncheck passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its\nprecondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after\nits initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any\nsubsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().\n\nTo resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment\ndirectly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the\nparent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on\nevent->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is\nnon-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing\nin child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.\n\n[ mingo: Expanded the changelog from another email by Gabriel Shahrouzi. ]",

The read call can create an order-0 folio to\nread the first 4096 bytes from the disk.  But then udev is preempted.\n\nNext, someone tries to mount an 8k-sectorsize filesystem from the same\nblock device.  The filesystem calls set_blksize, which sets i_blksize to\n8192 and the minimum folio order to 1.\n\nNow udev resumes, still holding the order-0 folio it allocated.  It then\ntries to schedule a read bio and do_mpage_readahead tries to create\nbufferheads for the folio.  Unfortunately, blocks_per_folio == 0 because\nthe page size is 4096 but the blocksize is 8192 so no bufferheads are\nattached and the bh walk never sets bdev.  We then submit the bio with a\nNULL block device and crash.\n\nTherefore, truncate the page cache after flushing but before updating\ni_blksize.  However, that's not enough -- we also need to lock out file\nIO and page faults during the update.  Take both the i_rwsem and the\ninvalidate_lock in exclusive mode for invalidations, and in shared mode\nfor read/write operations.\n\nI don't know if this is the correct fix, but xfs/259 found it.",

If the device was already zoned,\ndisk->nr_zones would always equal md->nr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()\nreturned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk->nr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk->nr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

However, the state might\nhave been freed by the time of this lookup.\n\nCurrently, if the state is not found, only a counter is incremented.\nThe secpath (sp) extension on the skb is not removed, resulting in\nsp->len becoming 0.\n\nSubsequently, functions like __xfrm_policy_check() attempt to access\nfields such as xfrm_input_state(skb)->xso.type (which dereferences\nsp->xvec[sp->len - 1]) without first validating sp->len. This leads to\na crash when dereferencing an invalid state pointer.\n\nThis patch prevents the crash by explicitly removing the secpath\nextension from the skb if the xfrm state is not found after hardware\ndecryption. This ensures downstream functions do not operate on a\nzero-length secpath.\n\n BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff000002c8\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n PGD 282e067 P4D 282e067 PUD 0\n Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP\n CPU: 12 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/12 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc7_for_upstream_min_debug_2025_05_27_22_44 #1 NONE\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n RIP: 0010:__xfrm_policy_check+0x61a/0xa30\n Code: b6 77 7f 83 e6 02 74 14 4d 8b af d8 00 00 00 41 0f b6 45 05 c1 e0 03 48 98 49 01 c5 41 8b 45 00 83 e8 01 48 98 49 8b 44 c5 10 <0f> b6 80 c8 02 00 00 83 e0 0c 3c 04 0f 84 0c 02 00 00 31 ff 80 fa\n RSP: 0018:ffff88885fb04918 EFLAGS: 00010297\n RAX: ffffffff00000000 RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 0000000000000000\n RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000000000000002 RDI: 0000000000000000\n RBP: ffffffff8311af80 R08: 0000000000000020 R09: 00000000c2eda353\n R10: ffff88812be2bbc8 R11: 000000001faab533 R12: ffff88885fb049c8\n R13: ffff88812be2bbc8 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff88811896ae00\n FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8888dca82000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: ffffffff000002c8 CR3: 0000000243050002 CR4: 0000000000372eb0\n DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n Call Trace:\n  <IRQ>\n  ? try_to_wake_up+0x108/0x4c0\n  ? udp4_lib_lookup2+0xbe/0x150\n  ? udp_lib_lport_inuse+0x100/0x100\n  ? __udp4_lib_lookup+0x2b0/0x410\n  __xfrm_policy_check2.constprop.0+0x11e/0x130\n  udp_queue_rcv_one_skb+0x1d/0x530\n  udp_unicast_rcv_skb+0x76/0x90\n  __udp4_lib_rcv+0xa64/0xe90\n  ip_protocol_deliver_rcu+0x20/0x130\n  ip_local_deliver_finish+0x75/0xa0\n  ip_local_deliver+0xc1/0xd0\n  ? ip_protocol_deliver_rcu+0x130/0x130\n  ip_sublist_rcv+0x1f9/0x240\n  ? ip_rcv_finish_core+0x430/0x430\n  ip_list_rcv+0xfc/0x130\n  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x181/0x1e0\n  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x200/0x360\n  ? mlx5e_build_rx_skb+0x1bc/0xda0 [mlx5_core]\n  gro_receive_skb+0xfd/0x210\n  mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq+0x141/0x280 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5e_poll_rx_cq+0xcc/0x8e0 [mlx5_core]\n  ? mlx5e_handle_rx_dim+0x91/0xd0 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5e_napi_poll+0x114/0xab0 [mlx5_core]\n  __napi_poll+0x25/0x170\n  net_rx_action+0x32d/0x3a0\n  ? mlx5_eq_comp_int+0x8d/0x280 [mlx5_core]\n  ? notifier_call_chain+0x33/0xa0\n  handle_softirqs+0xda/0x250\n  irq_exit_rcu+0x6d/0xc0\n  common_interrupt+0x81/0xa0\n  </IRQ>",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal\n\nThis issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and\nfq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new\nlimit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.",

The host uses this pointer to process all of\nthe TREs between it and the host's local copy of the ring's read pointer.\nThis works when processing completion for chained transactions, but can\nlead to nasty results if the device sends an event for a single-element\ntransaction with a read pointer that is multiple elements ahead of the\nhost's read pointer.\n\nFor instance, if the host accesses an event ring while the device is\nupdating it, the pointer inside of the event might still point to an old\nTRE. If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer\npointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed.\n\nThis behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without\n'commit 6f18d174b73d (\"bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer\nis written\")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before\nupdating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to\naccess the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the\nchance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an\nevent pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed\none, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all\nof the TREs in between the two read pointers.\n\nThis commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the\nevent points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.\n\n[mani: added stable tag and reworded commit message]",

During hidinput_connect()\nall input and output reports are processed and corresponding hid_inputs\nare allocated and configured via hidinput_configure_usages(). This\nprocess involves slot tagging report fields and configuring usages\nby setting relevant bits in the capability bitmaps. However it is possible\nthat the capability bitmaps are not set at all leading to the subsequent\nhidinput_has_been_populated() check to fail leading to the freeing of the\nhid_input and the underlying input device.\n\nThis becomes problematic because a malicious HID device like a\nASUS ROG N-Key keyboard can trigger the above scenario via a\nspecially crafted descriptor which then leads to a user-after-free\nwhen the name of the freed input device is written to later on after\nhid_hw_start().

As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.",

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block\nis expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff888107e28800 (size 2048):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    b1 a6 7c 11 81 88 ff ff e0 5b b3 10 81 88 ff ff  ..|......[......\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 aa b0 84 ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab374e>] __kmalloc+0x4e/0x90\n    [<ffffffff832aec6d>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x34d/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n    [<ffffffff8379d29a>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x13a/0x1e0\n    [<ffffffff8379d50c>] __sys_sendmsg+0x11c/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff843b9ce0>] do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\nunreferenced object 0xffff88816d2c0400 (size 1024):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 57 f6 38 be 00 00 00 00  @.......W.8.....\n    10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff 10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff  ..,m......,m....\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab36c1>] __kmalloc_node+0x51/0x90\n    [<ffffffff81a8ed96>] kvmalloc_node+0xa6/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff82827d03>] bucket_table_alloc.isra.0+0x83/0x460\n    [<ffffffff82828d2b>] rhashtable_init+0x43b/0x7c0\n    [<ffffffff832aed48>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x428/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n\n[2]\n # tc qdisc add dev swp1 clsact\n # tc chain add dev swp1 ingress proto ip chain 1 flower dst_ip 0.0.0.0/32\n # tc qdisc del dev\n---truncated---",

However, in i915 there are two separate code\npaths, which both release either drvdata or hwmon and either can be\nreleased before the other. These code paths (for device unbind) are as\nfollows (see also the bug referenced below):\n\nCall Trace:\nrelease_nodes+0x11/0x70\ndevres_release_group+0xb2/0x110\ncomponent_unbind_all+0x8d/0xa0\ncomponent_del+0xa5/0x140\nintel_pxp_tee_component_fini+0x29/0x40 [i915]\nintel_pxp_fini+0x33/0x80 [i915]\ni915_driver_remove+0x4c/0x120 [i915]\ni915_pci_remove+0x19/0x30 [i915]\npci_device_remove+0x32/0xa0\ndevice_release_driver_internal+0x19c/0x200\nunbind_store+0x9c/0xb0\n\nand\n\nCall Trace:\nrelease_nodes+0x11/0x70\ndevres_release_all+0x8a/0xc0\ndevice_unbind_cleanup+0x9/0x70\ndevice_release_driver_internal+0x1c1/0x200\nunbind_store+0x9c/0xb0\n\nThis means that in i915, if use devm, we cannot gurantee that hwmon will\nalways be released before drvdata. Which means that we have a uaf if hwmon\nsysfs is accessed when drvdata has been released but hwmon hasn't.\n\nThe only way out of this seems to be do get rid of devm_ and release/free\neverything explicitly during device unbind.\n\nv2: Change commit message and other minor code changes\nv3: Cleanup from i915_hwmon_register on error (Armin Wolf)\nv4: Eliminate potential static analyzer warning (Rodrigo)\n    Eliminate fetch_and_zero (Jani)\nv5: Restore previous logic for ddat_gt->hwmon_dev error return (Andi)",

Those endpoints share a common switch-decoder in the topology\n(3.0). At teardown, 2), decoder14.0 is the first to be removed and hits\nthe \"out of order reset case\" in the switch decoder. The effect though\nis that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and\nreferencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3\ntrips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been\ndeleted.\n\nThe fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no\nmandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces\nin-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit. So, rather\nthan fail and leave objects dangling, always remove them.\n\nIn support of making cxl_region_decode_reset() always succeed,\ncxl_region_invalidate_memregion() failures are turned into warnings.\nCrashing the kernel is ok there since system integrity is at risk if\ncaches cannot be managed around physical address mutation events like\nCXL region destruction.\n\nA new device_for_each_child_reverse_from() is added to cleanup\nport->commit_end after all dependent decoders have been disabled. In\nother words if decoders are allocated 0->1->2 and disabled 1->2->0 then\nport->commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and\nit decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously.",

Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",

A simple curl to a HTTP\nbackend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large\npacket sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)\nwhile others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.\n\nIn fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the\nnode with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire\nfor the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been\n152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes\nwas padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we\nsaw user/payload data from prior processed packets).\n\nWe only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and\nthe backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request\ngot dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even\nthough the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to\nthe MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let\nthe curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the\npadding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).\n\nCommit e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") was too eager\nto also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd->len to rbi->len. It really needs\nto stick to rcd->len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.\nThe latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and\nit indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp->{data,data_end}\nparts. For e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") the\nrelevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the\nxdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp->frame_sz. With that fixed, traffic on\nthe wire looks good again.",

Ensure that\nchild_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within\ninherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the\ncleanup code.\n\nDetails:\n\nThere's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of\nmultiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not\na single regression.\n\nThe code initially incremented refcount then assigned context\nimmediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early\nvalidity check for child_event was added before the\nrefcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was\nadded, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.\nThe problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial\ncheck passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its\nprecondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after\nits initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any\nsubsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().\n\nTo resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment\ndirectly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the\nparent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on\nevent->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is\nnon-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing\nin child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.\n\n[ mingo: Expanded the changelog from another email by Gabriel Shahrouzi. ]",

Even though the code setting the flag\nis designed to prevent it, there are subtle cases where the flag could be\ntrue at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. This\nresults in the mutex not being unlocked, resulting in a deadlock.\n\nFix it by making the opt3001_irq() code generally more robust, reading the\nflag into a variable and using the variable value at both stages.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix race between set_blocksize and read paths\n\nWith the new large sector size support, it's now the case that\nset_blocksize can change i_blksize and the folio order in a manner that\nconflicts with a concurrent reader and causes a kernel crash.\n\nSpecifically, let's say that udev-worker calls libblkid to detect the\nlabels on a block device.  The read call can create an order-0 folio to\nread the first 4096 bytes from the disk.  But then udev is preempted.\n\nNext, someone tries to mount an 8k-sectorsize filesystem from the same\nblock device.  The filesystem calls set_blksize, which sets i_blksize to\n8192 and the minimum folio order to 1.\n\nNow udev resumes, still holding the order-0 folio it allocated.  It then\ntries to schedule a read bio and do_mpage_readahead tries to create\nbufferheads for the folio.  Unfortunately, blocks_per_folio == 0 because\nthe page size is 4096 but the blocksize is 8192 so no bufferheads are\nattached and the bh walk never sets bdev.  We then submit the bio with a\nNULL block device and crash.\n\nTherefore, truncate the page cache after flushing but before updating\ni_blksize.  However, that's not enough -- we also need to lock out file\nIO and page faults during the update.  Take both the i_rwsem and the\ninvalidate_lock in exclusive mode for invalidations, and in shared mode\nfor read/write operations.\n\nI don't know if this is the correct fix, but xfs/259 found it.",

If the device was already zoned,\ndisk->nr_zones would always equal md->nr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()\nreturned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk->nr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk->nr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

[0]\n\nFrom the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while\nits device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.\n\nOnce the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls\nhci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct\nvhci_data, which is set to hci_dev->dev->driver_data.\n\nThe problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking\nhdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be\nanother thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before\nthe unlink operation.\n\nWe can use SRCU for such synchronisation.\n\nLet's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion\nin hci_unregister_dev().\n\nAnother option would be to restore hci_dev->destruct(), which was\nremoved in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused\nhci-destruct cb\").

So instead\nwe should look at the bigger problem, namely \"weird locking/scheduling\"\nof the iavf. The first step to fix that is to remove the crit lock.\nI will followup with a -next series that simplifies scheduling/tasks.\n\nCancel the work without netdev lock (weird unlock+lock scheme),\nto fix the [splat2] (which would be totally ugly if we would kept\nthe crit lock).\n\nExtend protected part of iavf_watchdog_task() to include scheduling\nmore work.\n\nNote that the removed comment in iavf_reset_task() was misplaced,\nit belonged to inside of the removed if condition, so it's gone now.\n\n[splat1] - w/o this patch - The deadlock during VF removal:\n     WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n     sh/3825 is trying to acquire lock:\n      ((work_completion)(&(&adapter->watchdog_task)->work)){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: start_flush_work+0x1a1/0x470\n          but task is already holding lock:\n      (&adapter->crit_lock){+.+.}-{4:4}, at: iavf_remove+0xd1/0x690 [iavf]\n          which lock already depends on the new lock.\n\n[splat2] - when cancelling work under crit lock, w/o this series,\n\t   see [2] for the band aid attempt\n    WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n    sh/3550 is trying to acquire lock:\n    ((wq_completion)iavf){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: touch_wq_lockdep_map+0x26/0x90\n        but task is already holding lock:\n    (&dev->lock){+.+.}-{4:4}, at: iavf_remove+0xa6/0x6e0 [iavf]\n        which lock already depends on the new lock.\n\n[1] fc2e6b3b132a (\"iavf: Rework mutexes for better synchronisation\")\n[2] https://github.com/pkitszel/linux/commit/52dddbfc2bb60294083f5711a158a",

However, the state might\nhave been freed by the time of this lookup.\n\nCurrently, if the state is not found, only a counter is incremented.\nThe secpath (sp) extension on the skb is not removed, resulting in\nsp->len becoming 0.\n\nSubsequently, functions like __xfrm_policy_check() attempt to access\nfields such as xfrm_input_state(skb)->xso.type (which dereferences\nsp->xvec[sp->len - 1]) without first validating sp->len. This leads to\na crash when dereferencing an invalid state pointer.\n\nThis patch prevents the crash by explicitly removing the secpath\nextension from the skb if the xfrm state is not found after hardware\ndecryption. This ensures downstream functions do not operate on a\nzero-length secpath.\n\n BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff000002c8\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n PGD 282e067 P4D 282e067 PUD 0\n Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP\n CPU: 12 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/12 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc7_for_upstream_min_debug_2025_05_27_22_44 #1 NONE\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n RIP: 0010:__xfrm_policy_check+0x61a/0xa30\n Code: b6 77 7f 83 e6 02 74 14 4d 8b af d8 00 00 00 41 0f b6 45 05 c1 e0 03 48 98 49 01 c5 41 8b 45 00 83 e8 01 48 98 49 8b 44 c5 10 <0f> b6 80 c8 02 00 00 83 e0 0c 3c 04 0f 84 0c 02 00 00 31 ff 80 fa\n RSP: 0018:ffff88885fb04918 EFLAGS: 00010297\n RAX: ffffffff00000000 RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 0000000000000000\n RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000000000000002 RDI: 0000000000000000\n RBP: ffffffff8311af80 R08: 0000000000000020 R09: 00000000c2eda353\n R10: ffff88812be2bbc8 R11: 000000001faab533 R12: ffff88885fb049c8\n R13: ffff88812be2bbc8 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff88811896ae00\n FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8888dca82000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: ffffffff000002c8 CR3: 0000000243050002 CR4: 0000000000372eb0\n DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n Call Trace:\n  <IRQ>\n  ? try_to_wake_up+0x108/0x4c0\n  ? udp4_lib_lookup2+0xbe/0x150\n  ? udp_lib_lport_inuse+0x100/0x100\n  ? __udp4_lib_lookup+0x2b0/0x410\n  __xfrm_policy_check2.constprop.0+0x11e/0x130\n  udp_queue_rcv_one_skb+0x1d/0x530\n  udp_unicast_rcv_skb+0x76/0x90\n  __udp4_lib_rcv+0xa64/0xe90\n  ip_protocol_deliver_rcu+0x20/0x130\n  ip_local_deliver_finish+0x75/0xa0\n  ip_local_deliver+0xc1/0xd0\n  ? ip_protocol_deliver_rcu+0x130/0x130\n  ip_sublist_rcv+0x1f9/0x240\n  ? ip_rcv_finish_core+0x430/0x430\n  ip_list_rcv+0xfc/0x130\n  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x181/0x1e0\n  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x200/0x360\n  ? mlx5e_build_rx_skb+0x1bc/0xda0 [mlx5_core]\n  gro_receive_skb+0xfd/0x210\n  mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq+0x141/0x280 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5e_poll_rx_cq+0xcc/0x8e0 [mlx5_core]\n  ? mlx5e_handle_rx_dim+0x91/0xd0 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5e_napi_poll+0x114/0xab0 [mlx5_core]\n  __napi_poll+0x25/0x170\n  net_rx_action+0x32d/0x3a0\n  ? mlx5_eq_comp_int+0x8d/0x280 [mlx5_core]\n  ? notifier_call_chain+0x33/0xa0\n  handle_softirqs+0xda/0x250\n  irq_exit_rcu+0x6d/0xc0\n  common_interrupt+0x81/0xa0\n  </IRQ>",

Values greater than the\nmaximum are already being checked for there.\n\nAlso switch the calculation in dir_make_exhash() to use ilog2() to\nclarify how the depth is calculated.\n\nTested with the syzkaller repro.c and xfstests '-g quick'.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal\n\nThis issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and\nfq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new\nlimit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.",

The host uses this pointer to process all of\nthe TREs between it and the host's local copy of the ring's read pointer.\nThis works when processing completion for chained transactions, but can\nlead to nasty results if the device sends an event for a single-element\ntransaction with a read pointer that is multiple elements ahead of the\nhost's read pointer.\n\nFor instance, if the host accesses an event ring while the device is\nupdating it, the pointer inside of the event might still point to an old\nTRE. If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer\npointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed.\n\nThis behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without\n'commit 6f18d174b73d (\"bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer\nis written\")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before\nupdating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to\naccess the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the\nchance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an\nevent pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed\none, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all\nof the TREs in between the two read pointers.\n\nThis commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the\nevent points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.\n\n[mani: added stable tag and reworded commit message]",

During hidinput_connect()\nall input and output reports are processed and corresponding hid_inputs\nare allocated and configured via hidinput_configure_usages(). This\nprocess involves slot tagging report fields and configuring usages\nby setting relevant bits in the capability bitmaps. However it is possible\nthat the capability bitmaps are not set at all leading to the subsequent\nhidinput_has_been_populated() check to fail leading to the freeing of the\nhid_input and the underlying input device.\n\nThis becomes problematic because a malicious HID device like a\nASUS ROG N-Key keyboard can trigger the above scenario via a\nspecially crafted descriptor which then leads to a user-after-free\nwhen the name of the freed input device is written to later on after\nhid_hw_start(). Below, report 93 intentionally utilises the\nHID_UP_UNDEFINED Usage Page which is skipped during usage\nconfiguration, leading to the frees.\n\n0x05, 0x0D,        // Usage Page (Digitizer)\n0x09, 0x05,        // Usage (Touch Pad)\n0xA1, 0x01,        // Collection (Application)\n0x85, 0x0D,        //   Report ID (13)\n0x06, 0x00, 0xFF,  //   Usage Page (Vendor Defined 0xFF00)\n0x09, 0xC5,        //   Usage (0xC5)\n0x15, 0x00,        //   Logical Minimum (0)\n0x26, 0xFF, 0x00,  //   Logical Maximum (255)\n0x75, 0x08,        //   Report Size (8)\n0x95, 0x04,        //   Report Count (4)\n0xB1, 0x02,        //   Feature (Data,Var,Abs)\n0x85, 0x5D,        //   Report ID (93)\n0x06, 0x00, 0x00,  //   Usage Page (Undefined)\n0x09, 0x01,        //   Usage (0x01)\n0x15, 0x00,        //   Logical Minimum (0)\n0x26, 0xFF, 0x00,  //   Logical Maximum (255)\n0x75, 0x08,        //   Report Size (8)\n0x95, 0x1B,        //   Report Count (27)\n0x81, 0x02,        //   Input (Data,Var,Abs)\n0xC0,              // End Collection\n\nBelow is the KASAN splat after triggering the UAF:\n\n[   21.672709] ==================================================================\n[   21.673700] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in asus_probe+0xeeb/0xf80\n[   21.673700] Write of size 8 at addr ffff88810a0ac000 by task kworker/1:2/54\n[   21.673700]\n[   21.673700] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 54 Comm: kworker/1:2 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc4-g9773391cf4dd-dirty #36 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n[   21.673700] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.2-debian-1.16.2-1 04/01/2014\n[   21.673700] Call Trace:\n[   21.673700]  <TASK>\n[   21.673700]  dump_stack_lvl+0x5f/0x80\n[   21.673700]  print_report+0xd1/0x660\n[   21.673700]  kasan_report+0xe5/0x120\n[   21.673700]  __asan_report_store8_noabort+0x1b/0x30\n[   21.673700]  asus_probe+0xeeb/0xf80\n[   21.673700]  hid_device_probe+0x2ee/0x700\n[   21.673700]  really_probe+0x1c6/0x6b0\n[   21.673700]  __driver_probe_device+0x24f/0x310\n[   21.673700]  driver_probe_device+0x4e/0x220\n[...]\n[   21.673700]\n[   21.673700] Allocated by task 54:\n[   21.673700]  kasan_save_stack+0x3d/0x60\n[   21.673700]  kasan_save_track+0x18/0x40\n[   21.673700]  kasan_save_alloc_info+0x3b/0x50\n[   21.673700]  __kasan_kmalloc+0x9c/0xa0\n[   21.673700]  __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x139/0x340\n[   21.673700]  input_allocate_device+0x44/0x370\n[   21.673700]  hidinput_connect+0xcb6/0x2630\n[   21.673700]  hid_connect+0xf74/0x1d60\n[   21.673700]  hid_hw_start+0x8c/0x110\n[   21.673700]  asus_probe+0x5a3/0xf80\n[   21.673700]  hid_device_probe+0x2ee/0x700\n[   21.673700]  really_probe+0x1c6/0x6b0\n[   21.673700]  __driver_probe_device+0x24f/0x310\n[   21.673700]  driver_probe_device+0x4e/0x220\n[...]\n[   21.673700]\n[   21.673700] Freed by task 54:\n[   21.673700]  kasan_save_stack+0x3d/0x60\n[   21.673700]  kasan_save_track+0x18/0x40\n[   21.673700]  kasan_save_free_info+0x3f/0x60\n[   21.673700]  __kasan_slab_free+0x3c/0x50\n[   21.673700]  kfre\n---truncated---",

Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start\n   the process to exit idle or notify idle.\n\nIt's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without\ndriver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver\nallow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one\nof optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.\n\n2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper\n   that maintains this SW state.\n\nThis works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the\nDMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit\nidle so we don't enter an infinite loop.\n\n3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or\n   waiting for DMCUB idle.\n\nThis patch takes care of 1/2.

The arithmetic\nimplies adding together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The\nregister was checked to be below 1<<29 when it was variable, but not\nwhen it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in which\ncase it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller\nchecked it to be below 1<<29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a\nkfunc (in which case it can be a u32 [2]). Between the register being\ninconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset being up to an\nu32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were\ncurrently used for arithmetic.\n\n[1] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L7494-L7498\n[2] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L11904",

If overflow is detected, CPU switches to\n`shadow_stack` temporarily before switching finally to per-cpu\n`overflow_stack`.\n\nIf two CPUs/harts are racing and end up in over flowing kernel stack, one\nor both will end up corrupting each other state because `shadow_stack` is\nnot per-cpu. This patch optimizes per-cpu overflow stack switch by\ndirectly picking per-cpu `overflow_stack` and gets rid of `shadow_stack`.\n\nFollowing are the changes in this patch\n\n - Defines an asm macro to obtain per-cpu symbols in destination\n   register.\n - In entry.S, when overflow is detected, per-cpu overflow stack is\n   located using per-cpu asm macro. Computing per-cpu symbol requires\n   a temporary register. x31 is saved away into CSR_SCRATCH\n   (CSR_SCRATCH is anyways zero since we're in kernel).\n\nPlease see Links for additional relevant disccussion and alternative\nsolution.\n\nTested by `echo EXHAUST_STACK > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT`\nKernel crash log below\n\n Insufficient stack space to handle exception!/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT\n Task stack:     [0xff20000010a98000..0xff20000010a9c000]\n Overflow stack: [0xff600001f7d98370..0xff600001f7d99370]\n CPU: 1 PID: 205 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.1.0-rc2-00001-g328a1f96f7b9 #34\n Hardware name: riscv-virtio,qemu (DT)\n epc : __memset+0x60/0xfc\n  ra : recursive_loop+0x48/0xc6 [lkdtm]\n epc : ffffffff808de0e4 ra : ffffffff0163a752 sp : ff20000010a97e80\n  gp : ffffffff815c0330 tp : ff600000820ea280 t0 : ff20000010a97e88\n  t1 : 000000000000002e t2 : 3233206874706564 s0 : ff20000010a982b0\n  s1 : 0000000000000012 a0 : ff20000010a97e88 a1 : 0000000000000000\n  a2 : 0000000000000400 a3 : ff20000010a98288 a4 : 0000000000000000\n  a5 : 0000000000000000 a6 : fffffffffffe43f0 a7 : 00007fffffffffff\n  s2 : ff20000010a97e88 s3 : ffffffff01644680 s4 : ff20000010a9be90\n  s5 : ff600000842ba6c0 s6 : 00aaaaaac29e42b0 s7 : 00fffffff0aa3684\n  s8 : 00aaaaaac2978040 s9 : 0000000000000065 s10: 00ffffff8a7cad10\n  s11: 00ffffff8a76a4e0 t3 : ffffffff815dbaf4 t4 : ffffffff815dbaf4\n  t5 : ffffffff815dbab8 t6 : ff20000010a9bb48\n status: 0000000200000120 badaddr: ff20000010a97e88 cause: 000000000000000f\n Kernel panic - not syncing: Kernel stack overflow\n CPU: 1 PID: 205 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.1.0-rc2-00001-g328a1f96f7b9 #34\n Hardware name: riscv-virtio,qemu (DT)\n Call Trace:\n [<ffffffff80006754>] dump_backtrace+0x30/0x38\n [<ffffffff808de798>] show_stack+0x40/0x4c\n [<ffffffff808ea2a8>] dump_stack_lvl+0x44/0x5c\n [<ffffffff808ea2d8>] dump_stack+0x18/0x20\n [<ffffffff808dec06>] panic+0x126/0x2fe\n [<ffffffff800065ea>] walk_stackframe+0x0/0xf0\n [<ffffffff0163a752>] recursive_loop+0x48/0xc6 [lkdtm]\n SMP: stopping secondary CPUs\n ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Kernel stack overflow ]---",

Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the\ncxl_port driver.\n\nGiven that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage\ngoes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through a\ncxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the\nentire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.\n\nThe delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being\ncalled to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to\nteardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through\n->remove().\n\nThat care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent.\nWhich requires 2 bugs to be fixed:\n\n1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free\n   scenarios like this signature:\n\n    BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, kworker/u56:0/11\n    Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS edk2-20230524-3.fc38 05/24/2023\n    Workqueue: cxl_port detach_memdev [cxl_core]\n    RIP: 0010:spin_bug+0x65/0xa0\n    Call Trace:\n      do_raw_spin_lock+0x69/0xa0\n     __mutex_lock+0x695/0xb80\n     delete_endpoint+0xad/0x150 [cxl_core]\n     devres_release_all+0xb8/0x110\n     device_unbind_cleanup+0xe/0x70\n     device_release_driver_internal+0x1d2/0x210\n     detach_memdev+0x15/0x20 [cxl_core]\n     process_one_work+0x1e3/0x4c0\n     worker_thread+0x1dd/0x3d0\n\n2/ In the case of RCH topologies, the parent device that needs to be\n   locked is not always @port->dev as returned by cxl_mem_find_port(), use\n   endpoint->dev.parent instead.",

We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's\nchecked most frequently during backtracking.\n\nThis change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of\nprecision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known\ndeficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of\nverified states, explored in the subsequent patches.\n\nThere are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files\naccording to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).\n\nFile                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)\n--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------\ntest_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)\n\nNote, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to\nminimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between\nbpf and bpf-next trees.\n\nNotice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of\ninstruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of\nrelying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we\nalready have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we\nadded jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but\nalso we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we\ndon't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is\npresent.\n\nRelying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one\nthat was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.\n\n  [0] https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20231110002638.4168352-3-andrii@kernel.org/",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: entry: fix ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n\nCurrently the ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround isn't\nquite right, as it is supposed to be applied after the last explicit\nmemory access, but is immediately followed by an LDR.\n\nThe ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to\nhandle Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295,\nwhich are described in:\n\n* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en\n* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en\n\nIn both cases the workaround is described as:\n\n| If pagetable isolation is disabled, the context switch logic in the\n| kernel can be updated to execute the following sequence on affected\n| cores before exiting to EL0, and after all explicit memory accesses:\n|\n| 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including\n|    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`.\n|\n| 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.\n\nThe important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed \"after all\nexplicit memory accesses\".\n\nUnfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by\nan LDR, as we have:\n\n| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n| \ttlbi\tvale1, xzr\n| \tdsb\tnsh\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n| alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0\n| \tldr\tlr, [sp, #S_LR]\n| \tadd\tsp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE\t\t// restore sp\n| \teret\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n|\n| [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]\n\nThis patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB\nimmediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.\n\nThe ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives\ncannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for\nARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch\nto skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:\n\n| alternative_insn \"b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@\", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0\n| \t[ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]\n| .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@:\n|\n| \tldr\tlr, [sp, #S_LR]\n| \tadd\tsp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE\t\t// restore sp\n|\n| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n| \ttlbi\tvale1, xzr\n| \tdsb\tnsh\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n| \teret\n\nThe new structure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is\nnot in use; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the\nerratum:\n\n| Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the\n| issue from occurring.\n\n... and as per the workaround description quoted above, the workaround\nis only necessary \"If pagetable isolation is disabled\".",

Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, let\nthe remainder cpus stay in BIOS.\n\nThe potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] can\nbe overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PIC\nshould be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so it\nis better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].\n\nWith the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128,\notherwise system will crash with the following message.\n\n[    0.000000] CPU 0 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000420000004259, era == 90000000037a5f0c, ra == 90000000037a46ec\n[    0.000000] Oops[#1]:\n[    0.000000] CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Not tainted 6.8.0-rc2+ #192\n[    0.000000] Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS unknown 2/2/2022\n[    0.000000] pc 90000000037a5f0c ra 90000000037a46ec tp 9000000003c90000 sp 9000000003c93d60\n[    0.000000] a0 0000000000000019 a1 9000000003d93bc0 a2 0000000000000000 a3 9000000003c93bd8\n[    0.000000] a4 9000000003c93a74 a5 9000000083c93a67 a6 9000000003c938f0 a7 0000000000000005\n[    0.000000] t0 0000420000004201 t1 0000000000000000 t2 0000000000000001 t3 0000000000000001\n[    0.000000] t4 0000000000000003 t5 0000000000000000 t6 0000000000000030 t7 0000000000000063\n[    0.000000] t8 0000000000000014 u0 ffffffffffffffff s9 0000000000000000 s0 9000000003caee98\n[    0.000000] s1 90000000041b0480 s2 9000000003c93da0 s3 9000000003c93d98 s4 9000000003c93d90\n[    0.000000] s5 9000000003caa000 s6 000000000a7fd000 s7 000000000f556b60 s8 000000000e0a4330\n[    0.000000]    ra: 90000000037a46ec platform_init+0x214/0x250\n[    0.000000]   ERA: 90000000037a5f0c efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94\n[    0.000000]  CRMD: 000000b0 (PLV0 -IE -DA +PG DACF=CC DACM=CC -WE)\n[    0.000000]  PRMD: 00000000 (PPLV0 -PIE -PWE)\n[    0.000000]  EUEN: 00000000 (-FPE -SXE -ASXE -BTE)\n[    0.000000]  ECFG: 00070800 (LIE=11 VS=7)\n[    0.000000] ESTAT: 00010000 [PIL] (IS= ECode=1 EsubCode=0)\n[    0.000000]  BADV: 0000420000004259\n[    0.000000]  PRID: 0014c010 (Loongson-64bit, Loongson-3A5000)\n[    0.000000] Modules linked in:\n[    0.000000] Process swapper (pid: 0, threadinfo=(____ptrval____), task=(____ptrval____))\n[    0.000000] Stack : 9000000003c93a14 9000000003800898 90000000041844f8 90000000037a46ec\n[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 0000000008290000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000\n[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000019d8000 000000000f556b60\n[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08 9000000003ca7700 9000000003800000\n[    0.000000]         9000000003c93e50 9000000003800898 9000000003800108 90000000037a484c\n[    0.000000]         000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08\n[    0.000000]         9000000003ca7700 9000000004184000 0000000000200000 000000000e02b018\n[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 90000000037a0790 9000000003800108 0000000000000000\n[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000\n[    0.000000]         000000000f556b08 000000000eaae298 000000000eaa5040 0000000000200000\n[    0.000000]         ...\n[    0.000000] Call Trace:\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a5f0c>] efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a46ec>] platform_init+0x214/0x250\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a484c>] setup_arch+0x124/0x45c\n[    0.000000] [<90000000037a0790>] start_kernel+0x90/0x670\n[    0.000000] [<900000000378b0d8>] kernel_entry+0xd8/0xdc",

Since the\ndelalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent\nrange so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're\nchecking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.\n\nWith this patch applied we no longer deadlock with my testcase.",

E.g., for\nmulti-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.\n\nBecause of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero\nthere could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.\n\nThis patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to\nafter RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different\ndeallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred\none is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred()\ncallback to happen after RCU GP.\n\nBPF is using two flavors of RCU: \"classic\" non-sleepable one and RCU\ntasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are\nused. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF\nprogram's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for\nnon-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP\n(taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPF\nprogram is sleepable.\n\nWe use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference\nlink during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use\ndeferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose\nraw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtime\nas well.",

Since\nthis relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock\nsituation as the previous patch.\n\nIt would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,\nas the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once\nasync_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized\nbefore it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to\narm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is\nsufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return\nHRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.\n\nHowever, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer\nbefore entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to\ntimer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback\nrunning concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is\nsignificantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration\nhappening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it\nthe struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.\n\nHence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after\nasync_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock\nissues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the\nglobal workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at\n_different_ points of time, so can share space).\n\nUpdate existing code comments to reflect the new state of affairs.",

This keeps\ntrack of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.\nWhenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding\ncancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an\nerror (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the\ncallback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock\nsituation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel\nand attempting to cancel one another.\n\nNote that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target\ntimer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from\na callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting\ncur->cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop\n(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the\ncaller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to\ncancel as it sees fit without running into errors.\n\nBackground on prior attempts:\n\nEarlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the\nfollowing pattern under timer->lock to publish cancellation status.\n\nlock(t->lock);\nt->cancelling = true;\nmb();\nif (cur->cancelling)\n\treturn -EDEADLK;\nunlock(t->lock);\nhrtimer_cancel(t->timer);\nt->cancelling = false;\n\nThe store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel\nrequests t->cancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely\nexecuting callback observes its cancellation status.\n\nIt would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel\nis done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was\nexplored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the\ntimer under timer->lock. This would ensure serialized access to the\ncancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight\nhrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur\nagain.\n\nThus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstanding\ncancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacks\nattempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel.",

The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if you hit\n   the right two race windows) - I've tested this in a kernel build with\n   some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description\n   of the race scenario.\n   On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even\n   theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table\n   if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven't tested this case).\n2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for\n   detecting PMDs that don't point to page tables.\n   On older kernels (before 6.5), you'd just have to win a single fairly\n   wide race to hit this.\n   I've tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()\n   patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86\n   VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr().\n3. On newer kernels (>=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed\n   to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven't tested that),\n   so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.\n\nI decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, one\nfix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernels\naffected by bugs 1+2.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThis fixes two issues.\n\nI discovered that the following race can occur:\n\n  mfill_atomic                other thread\n  ============                ============\n                              <zap PMD>\n  pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]\n  <bail if trans_huge>\n  <if none:>\n                              <pagefault creates transhuge zeropage>\n    __pte_alloc [no-op]\n                              <zap PMD>\n  <bail if pmd_trans_huge(*dst_pmd)>\n  BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))\n\nI have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls;\nthe BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.\n\nOn kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b (\"mm/pgtable: allow\npte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail\"), this can't lead to anything worse than\na BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed to\ndeal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels\n(<=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the two\nBUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.\n\nThe second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other types\nof huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can't catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs\n(in particular, migration PMDs).\n\nOn <=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on a\nPMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single,\nfairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), which\nassumes that the PMD points to a page table.\n\nBreakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which will\ncrash or maybe worse if there is no \"struct page\" for the address bits in\nthe migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is no\ncorresponding \"struct page\" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64\nlooks different).\n\nIf that didn't crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into what\nit wrongly thinks is a page table.\n\nAs part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge()\nbefore __pte_alloc() - that's redundant, we're going to have to check for\nthat after the __pte_alloc() anyway.\n\nBackport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels.",

If physical blocks are not submitted in\nthe incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency\nissues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()\nand BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.\n\nSecond, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for\nefficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement\neasily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in\nfuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages\nfor correctness.\n\nAdditionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be\ntruncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 (\"erofs: tidy\nup `struct z_erofs_bvec`\") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any\ndifference.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace\n\nThere is a potential infinite loop issue that can occur when using a\ncombination of tail calls and freplace.\n\nIn an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of\ntailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in\nentry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:\n\nentry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.\n\nThe problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to\nzero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism\nto never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, the solution is twofold:\n\n1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a\n   prog_array map.\n2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map\n   with an freplace program.\n\nThis ensures that:\n\n* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,\n  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.\n* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its\n  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.\n\nMoreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return\n-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a\nprog_array map.\n\nAdditionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a\ntab for proper formatting.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: improve shutdown sequence\n\nAlexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the\nlan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-> ...\n   -> dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -> ds->ops->phy_read()\n         -> lan9303_phy_read()\n            -> chip->ops->phy_read()\n               -> lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -> dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp->conduit->dsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev->dsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev->dsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds->ops->phy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must\n| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of\n| any reset commands.\n\nSo it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize\nconduit->dsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call\non this conduit.\n\nThe addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that\nioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer\npropagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.\n\nThe race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f\n(\"net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown\")\nfirst introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we\nstopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just\nreplaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit->dsa_ptr\n(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up).",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking\n\nRecent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues:\nunder load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions,\n\"Bad page state\"s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually\ndon't get to see how badly they end up without).  The relevant recent\nchanges being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin,\nimproved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.\n\nBefore fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(),\nwhich does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(),\nwhich is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm\ninternals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to\ncheck usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,\nwhich can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing\ncallers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).\n\nJust omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all\nof whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()\nwill tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no\nlonger has any callers (and will be deleted separately).\n\nSwapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio->memcg_data 0\nwithout checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;\nwhich is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg\n(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,\nwhen freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially\ncorrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0\nhere, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before\nresetting memcg_data.\n\nThat goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 (\"mm: thp: make deferred split\nshrinker memcg aware\"): which included a check on swapcache before adding\nto deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to\nswapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim\n(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue\ncould have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 (\"mm: split\nunderused THPs\") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes\nswapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.\n\nKeep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is\nno longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely\nto be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the\nqueue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.\n\nMemcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing\nfolio->memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the\ndeferred list, sometimes corrupting \"from\" memcg's list, like swapout. \nRefcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be\nused in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:\nmem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting\nof course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving\ncharge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:\nnobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.\n\nThe 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list\nto another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);\nbut that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 (\"mm: thp: don't need care\ndeferred split queue in memcg charge move path\"), which argued that the\nexistence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred\nlist.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.\n\nBackport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take\ncare that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There\nis not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.",

[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

Since the vPMU is requested, but not setup,\n   kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() fails in kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change().\n   As a result, KVM_RUN returns after enabling the timer, but before\n   incrementing 'userspace_irqchip_in_use':\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()\n       ret = kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable()\n           if (!vcpu->arch.pmu.created)\n               return -EINVAL;\n       if (ret)\n           return ret;\n       [...]\n       if (!irqchip_in_kernel(kvm))\n           static_branch_inc(&userspace_irqchip_in_use);\n - Userspace ignores the error and issues KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT again.\n   Since the timer is already enabled, control moves through the\n   following flow, ultimately hitting the WARN_ON():\n   kvm_timer_vcpu_reset()\n       if (timer->enabled)\n          kvm_timer_update_irq()\n              if (!userspace_irqchip())\n                  ret = kvm_vgic_inject_irq()\n                      ret = vgic_lazy_init()\n                          if (unlikely(!vgic_initialized(kvm)))\n                              if (kvm->arch.vgic.vgic_model !=\n                                  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2)\n                                      return -EBUSY;\n                  WARN_ON(ret);\n\nTheoretically, since userspace_irqchip_in_use's functionality can be\nsimply replaced by '!irqchip_in_kernel()', get rid of the static key\nto avoid the mismanagement, which also helps with the syzbot issue.",

As for now, the maximal read size for kvec iter is\nonly limited by fc->max_read. For virtio-fs, max_read is UINT_MAX, so\nfuse_direct_io() doesn't split the 10MB buffer. It saves the address and\nthe size of the 10MB-sized buffer in out_args[0] of a fuse request and\npasses the fuse request to virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock().\n\n4) virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock() uses virtio_fs_enqueue_req() to\nqueue the request. Because virtiofs need DMA-able address, so\nvirtio_fs_enqueue_req() uses kmalloc() to allocate a bounce buffer for\nall fuse args, copies these args into the bounce buffer and passed the\nphysical address of the bounce buffer to virtiofsd. The total length of\nthese fuse args for the passed fuse request is about 10MB, so\ncopy_args_to_argbuf() invokes kmalloc() with a 10MB size parameter and\nit triggers the warning in __alloc_pages():\n\n\tif (WARN_ON_ONCE_GFP(order > MAX_PAGE_ORDER, gfp))\n\t\treturn NULL;\n\n5) virtio_fs_enqueue_req() will retry the memory allocation in a\nkworker, but it won't help, because kmalloc() will always return NULL\ndue to the abnormal size and finit_module() will hang forever.\n\nA feasible solution is to limit the value of max_read for virtio-fs, so\nthe length passed to kmalloc() will be limited. However it will affect\nthe maximal read size for normal read. And for virtio-fs write initiated\nfrom kernel, it has the similar problem but now there is no way to limit\nfc->max_write in kernel.\n\nSo instead of limiting both the values of max_read and max_write in\nkernel, introducing use_pages_for_kvec_io in fuse_conn and setting it as\ntrue in virtiofs. When use_pages_for_kvec_io is enabled, fuse will use\npages instead of pointer to pass the KVEC_IO data.\n\nAfter switching to pages for KVEC_IO data, these pages will be used for\nDMA through virtio-fs. If these pages are backed by vmalloc(),\n{flush|invalidate}_kernel_vmap_range() are necessary to flush or\ninvalidate the cache before the DMA operation. So add two new fields in\nfuse_args_pages to record the base address of vmalloc area and the\ncondition indicating whether invalidation is needed. Perform the flush\nin fuse_get_user_pages() for write operations and the invalidation in\nfuse_release_user_pages() for read operations.\n\nIt may seem necessary to introduce another fie\n---truncated---",

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes\nidr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a\nsimilar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) is\nstill a spinlock.\n\nInstead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking\nhtab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring\nthe invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map\npointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion.\nTherefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these\nto-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.\n\nThere are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr:\n\n(1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIt invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of\nhtab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(),\nbecause the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems.\nIt may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the\ninvocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release\nthe newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer\nof the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and\nreleasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old\nelement, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old\nelement as well.\n\n(2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIts caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(),\nhtab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().\n\nFor htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after\nhtab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just\nlike lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list\nand invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe\nto reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these\nelements have been removed from the hash llist.\n\nBecause htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation,\n__htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept\nit as\n---truncated---",

It targets the\nsame problem as the following downstream commit:\n\n  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995\n\nUnlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe\ndevice if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k\nor iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the\ndriver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with\nexisting practices.\n\nUpon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an\nexample of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:\n\n  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible\n  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944\n\nWithout this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a\nPCIe device is connected.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log, added tag for stable releases]",

This\nmechanism typically returns values that increase monotonically over\ntime. Eventually, though, the newly allocated offset value wraps\nback to a low number (say, 2) which is smaller than other already-\nallocated offset values.\n\nYu Kuai <yukuai3@huawei.com> reports that, after commit 64a7ce76fb90\n(\"libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir\"), if a\ndirectory's offset allocator wraps, existing entries are no longer\nvisible via readdir/getdents because offset_readdir() stops listing\nentries once an entry's offset is larger than octx->next_offset.\nThese entries vanish persistently -- they can be looked up, but will\nnever again appear in readdir(3) output.\n\nThe reason for this is that the commit treats directory offsets as\nmonotonically increasing integer values rather than opaque cookies,\nand introduces this comparison:\n\n\tif (dentry2offset(dentry) >= last_index) {\n\nOn 64-bit platforms, the directory offset value upper bound is\n2^63 - 1.

Add these missing checks.\n\nIf we allow set_bar() to set e.g. a new BAR size that differs from the\nexisting BAR size, the new address translation range will be smaller than\nthe BAR size already determined by the host, which would mean that a read\npast the new BAR size would pass the iATU untranslated, which could allow\nthe host to read memory not belonging to the new struct pci_epf_bar.\n\nWhile at it, add comments which clarifies the support for dynamically\nchanging the physical address of a BAR.

For example, consider the\nfollowing program:\n\n    __attribute__((__noinline__))\n    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)\n    {\n        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);\n    }\n\n    SEC(\"tc\")\n    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)\n    {\n        int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;\n        if ((void *)(p + 1) > (void *)(long)sk->data_end) return TCX_DROP;\n        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);\n        *p = 42;\n        return TCX_PASS;\n    }\n\nAfter a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used\nsafely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list\nof such helpers.\n\nAt the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing\nhelper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when\nprocessing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to\nhelpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in\nthe caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not\nrejected by verifier.\n\nThis commit fixes the omission by computing field\nbpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main\nverification pass.\nchanges_pkt_data should be set if:\n- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data\n  returns true;\n- subprogram calls a global function,\n  for which bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data should be set.\n\nThe verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this\ninformation. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal\ndone by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:\n- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a\n  state when S is fully explored;\n- when S is fully explored:\n  - every direct helper call within S is explored\n    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);\n  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully\n    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).\n\nThe downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not\ntaken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead\nbecause of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume\nthat the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data\ncomputation.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug\n\nIn zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the\ncurrent CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used\nthroughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,\nit is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.\n\nIf the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,\nwe run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx\nare freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. \nacomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).\n\nThe problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (\"mm/zswap: move to use\ncrypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration\") when the switch to the\ncrypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was\nretrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the\nCPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the\ncrypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.\n\nUse the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating\nand freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure\nthat acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the\ncompression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after\nacquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new\nCPU.\n\nThe initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug\ncallback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is\nallocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU\nhotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by\ncompression/decompression.\n\nPreviously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This\nwould have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already\nholding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a\ndeadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but\nJohannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug\nnotifiers [2].\n\nAlternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:\n- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in\n  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in\n  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the\n  CPU is onlined.\n- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but\n  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could\n  result in subtle performance issues.\n\n[1]https://lkml.kernel.org/20241219212437.2714151-1-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[2]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107074724.1756696-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[3]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107222236.2715883-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n\n[yosryahmed@google.com: remove comment]",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect\n\nCurrently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,\nthe error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns\nan error, which continues running the calling function and eventually\nfrees the matcher that is being disconnected.\nThis leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,\nwhich in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.\n\nThis patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when\nsome FW command fails during disconnect.\n\nNote that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this\nproblem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection\nbetween matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is\nthe case with any other error handling during resource destruction.\n\nHowever, the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash\nthe machine with use-after-free error.",

When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:\n\nvhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);\n...\n\nkfree(vs->vs_tpg);\nvs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found\nmatch=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the\npointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:\n\nkfree(vs->vs_tpg);\nvs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf a scsi request is then sent we do:\n\nvhost_scsi_handle_vq -> vhost_scsi_get_req -> vhost_vq_get_backend\n\nwhich sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.\n\n2. Tpg dir removal hang:\n\nThis patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer\ntpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount\ndropping to -1.\n\nThe problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already\nin the vs->vs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so\ntarget_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their\nrefcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added\nin the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in\nprevious calls which are also in vs->vs_tpg.\n\nLater, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs->vs_tpg which will drop\ntheir refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg\nand will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.\n\n3. Tpg leak:\n\nThis fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be\nun-removable because the target name is overwritten when\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different\ntarget names.\n\nThe bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup\na vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls\nVHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we\nhaven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this\nhappens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite\nthe target name and the vs->vs_tpg array. Later when we do\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's\nname and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the\nvs->vs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing\ntarget_undepend_item on the tpgs.\n\nBecause of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major\nuser, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the\nissues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called\nif it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the\ntpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint\nfirst.",

As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over\nthe dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied\nany page tables.\n\nConsequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the\nPAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page\ntable was not copied.\n\nThe easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA\nif track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\"\nclearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()\nand performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll\nsimply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...\nwhich is also wrong.\n\nSo let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation\nsucceeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if\nanything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT\nflag after undoing the reservation.\n\nNote that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will\nget removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set\nthen, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be\nhappy.

Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL\nand wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.\n\nThread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),\nwhich may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by\nThread B.\n\n  Thread A (SIOCBRDELIF)           Thread B (SIOCBRDELBR)\n  ----------------------           ----------------------\n  sock_ioctl                       sock_ioctl\n  `- sock_do_ioctl                 `- br_ioctl_call\n     `- dev_ioctl                     `- br_ioctl_stub\n        |- rtnl_lock                     |\n        |- dev_ifsioc                    '\n        '  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n           |- netdev_hold(dev, ...)      .\n       /   |- rtnl_unlock  ------.       |\n       |   |- br_ioctl_call       `--->  |- rtnl_lock\n  Race |   |  `- br_ioctl_stub           |- br_del_bridge\n  Window   |     |                       |  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n       |   |     |  May take long        |  `- br_dev_delete(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |  under RTNL pressure  |     `- unregister_netdevice_queue(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |               |       `- rtnl_unlock\n       \\   |     |- rtnl_lock  <-'          `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     |- ...                        `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     `- rtnl_unlock                   |- __rtnl_unlock\n           |                                      |- netdev_wait_allrefs_any\n           |- netdev_put(dev, ...)  <----------------'\n                                                Wait refcnt decrement\n                                                and log splat below\n\nTo avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call\ndev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.\n\nIn the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:\n\n  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()\n  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()\n  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()\n  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()\n\n3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move\n1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().\n\nNote that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better\nperformed before RTNL.\n\nSIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since\nthe pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process\nthem there.\n\n[0]:\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for wpan3 to become free.

As a result, it is possible for a\nblock group to go unused and have 'btrfs_mark_bg_unused' called on it\nconcurrently with 'btrfs_create_pending_block_groups'. This causes a\nnumber of issues, which were fixed with the block group flag\n'BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW'.\n\nHowever, this fix is not quite complete.

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: Fix null-ptr-deref by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod.\n\nWhen I ran the repro [0] and waited a few seconds, I observed two\nLOCKDEP splats: a warning immediately followed by a null-ptr-deref. [1]\n\nReproduction Steps:\n\n  1) Mount CIFS\n  2) Add an iptables rule to drop incoming FIN packets for CIFS\n  3) Unmount CIFS\n  4) Unload the CIFS module\n  5) Remove the iptables rule\n\nAt step 3), the CIFS module calls sock_release() for the underlying\nTCP socket, and it returns quickly.  However, the socket remains in\nFIN_WAIT_1 because incoming FIN packets are dropped.\n\nAt this point, the module's refcnt is 0 while the socket is still\nalive, so the following rmmod command succeeds.\n\n  # ss -tan\n  State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port\n  FIN-WAIT-1 0      477        10.0.2.15:51062   10.0.0.137:445\n\n  # lsmod | grep cifs\n  cifs                 1159168  0\n\nThis highlights a discrepancy between the lifetime of the CIFS module\nand the underlying TCP socket.  Even after CIFS calls sock_release()\nand it returns, the TCP socket does not die immediately in order to\nclose the connection gracefully.\n\nWhile this is generally fine, it causes an issue with LOCKDEP because\nCIFS assigns a different lock class to the TCP socket's sk->sk_lock\nusing sock_lock_init_class_and_name().\n\nOnce an incoming packet is processed for the socket or a timer fires,\nsk->sk_lock is acquired.\n\nThen, LOCKDEP checks the lock context in check_wait_context(), where\nhlock_class() is called to retrieve the lock class.  However, since\nthe module has already been unloaded, hlock_class() logs a warning\nand returns NULL, triggering the null-ptr-deref.\n\nIf LOCKDEP is enabled, we must ensure that a module calling\nsock_lock_init_class_and_name() (CIFS, NFS, etc) cannot be unloaded\nwhile such a socket is still alive to prevent this issue.\n\nLet's hold the module reference in sock_lock_init_class_and_name()\nand release it when the socket is freed in sk_prot_free().\n\nNote that sock_lock_init() clears sk->sk_owner for svc_create_socket()\nthat calls sock_lock_init_class_and_name() for a listening socket,\nwhich clones a socket by sk_clone_lock() without GFP_ZERO.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS_SERVER=\"10.0.0.137\"\nCIFS_PATH=\"//${CIFS_SERVER}/Users/Administrator/Desktop/CIFS_TEST\"\nDEV=\"enp0s3\"\nCRED=\"/root/WindowsCredential.txt\"\n\nMNT=$(mktemp -d /tmp/XXXXXX)\nmount -t cifs ${CIFS_PATH} ${MNT} -o vers=3.0,credentials=${CRED},cache=none,echo_interval=1\n\niptables -A INPUT -s ${CIFS_SERVER} -j DROP\n\nfor i in $(seq 10);\ndo\n    umount ${MNT}\n    rmmod cifs\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nrm -r ${MNT}\n\niptables -D INPUT -s ${CIFS_SERVER} -j DROP\n\n[1]:\nDEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(1)\nWARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 0 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:234 hlock_class (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:234 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:223)\nModules linked in: cifs_arc4 nls_ucs2_utils cifs_md4 [last unloaded: cifs]\nCPU: 10 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/10 Not tainted 6.14.0 #36\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:hlock_class (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:234 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:223)\n...\nCall Trace:\n <IRQ>\n __lock_acquire (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:4853 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5178)\n lock_acquire (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:469 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5853 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5816)\n _raw_spin_lock_nested (kernel/locking/spinlock.c:379)\n tcp_v4_rcv (./include/linux/skbuff.h:1678 ./include/net/tcp.h:2547 net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:2350)\n...\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000c4\n PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\nPGD 0\nOops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\nCPU: 10 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/10 Tainted: G        W          6.14.0 #36\nTainted: [W]=WARN\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:__lock_acquire (kernel/\n---truncated---",

Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass\noperations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().\n\nAlthough in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,\nwe made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address\nfilters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,\nand setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the\nfact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as\nkernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick\nhack.\n\nIt seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim\n.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP\nin order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from\nrunning, although we could do that.\n\nAccepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.\nEspecially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different\nangle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even\nfor VLANs:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/\n\nWhat happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,\nthen the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.\n\nThis is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an\ninformational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see\nthat bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'\nexperience, to justify the logic.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize\n\nWhen running machines with 64k page size and a 16k nodesize we started\nseeing tree log corruption in production.  This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn't dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info->sectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb->start turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb->start 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info->sectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb->start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info->sectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 >> 12 = 1\n\nNow we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.\nWhat's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that's a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix\nit simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit.",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV\n\nRLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU\nregisters in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and\nregister reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This\nmeans that only one thread can access the registers at a time,\npreventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed\ncorrectly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a\nhigh-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to\nacquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in\namdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.\n\nThe call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being\ncalled, which attempts to acquire the mutex. This function is invoked\nfrom amdgpu_sriov_wreg, which in turn is called from\ngmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb.\n\nThe [ BUG: Invalid wait context ] indicates that a thread is trying to\nacquire a mutex while it is in a context that does not allow it to sleep\n(like holding a spinlock).\n\nFixes the below:\n\n[  253.013423] =============================\n[  253.013434] [ BUG: Invalid wait context ]\n[  253.013446] 6.12.0-amdstaging-drm-next-lol-050225 #14 Tainted: G     U     OE\n[  253.013464] -----------------------------\n[  253.013475] kworker/0:1/10 is trying to lock:\n[  253.013487] ffff9f30542e3cf8 (&adev->virt.rlcg_reg_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.013815] other info that might help us debug this:\n[  253.013827] context-{4:4}\n[  253.013835] 3 locks held by kworker/0:1/10:\n[  253.013847]  #0: ffff9f3040050f58 ((wq_completion)events){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: process_one_work+0x3f5/0x680\n[  253.013877]  #1: ffffb789c008be40 ((work_completion)(&wfc.work)){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: process_one_work+0x1d6/0x680\n[  253.013905]  #2: ffff9f3054281838 (&adev->gmc.invalidate_lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: gmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb+0x198/0x4f0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.014154] stack backtrace:\n[  253.014164] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10 Comm: kworker/0:1 Tainted: G     U     OE      6.12.0-amdstaging-drm-next-lol-050225 #14\n[  253.014189] Tainted: [U]=USER, [O]=OOT_MODULE, [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE\n[  253.014203] Hardware name: Microsoft Corporation Virtual Machine/Virtual Machine, BIOS Hyper-V UEFI Release v4.1 11/18/2024\n[  253.014224] Workqueue: events work_for_cpu_fn\n[  253.014241] Call Trace:\n[  253.014250]  <TASK>\n[  253.014260]  dump_stack_lvl+0x9b/0xf0\n[  253.014275]  dump_stack+0x10/0x20\n[  253.014287]  __lock_acquire+0xa47/0x2810\n[  253.014303]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.014321]  lock_acquire+0xd1/0x300\n[  253.014333]  ? amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.014562]  ? __lock_acquire+0xa6b/0x2810\n[  253.014578]  __mutex_lock+0x85/0xe20\n[  253.014591]  ? amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.014782]  ? sched_clock_noinstr+0x9/0x10\n[  253.014795]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.014808]  ? local_clock_noinstr+0xe/0xc0\n[  253.014822]  ? amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015012]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.015029]  mutex_lock_nested+0x1b/0x30\n[  253.015044]  ? mutex_lock_nested+0x1b/0x30\n[  253.015057]  amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015249]  amdgpu_sriov_wreg+0xc5/0xd0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015435]  gmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb+0x44b/0x4f0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015667]  gfx_v11_0_hw_init+0x499/0x29c0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015901]  ? __pfx_smu_v13_0_update_pcie_parameters+0x10/0x10 [amdgpu]\n[  253.016159]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.016173]  ? smu_hw_init+0x18d/0x300 [amdgpu]\n[  253.016403]  amdgpu_device_init+0x29ad/0x36a0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.016614]  amdgpu_driver_load_kms+0x1a/0xc0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.0170\n---truncated---",

Since the addr range [addr1 + 4096,\naddr1 + 8192] still maps the file, it will take vma_merge_new_range to\nexpand the range, and then do uprobe_mmap in vma_complete.  Since the\nmerged vma pgoff is also zero offset, it will install uprobe anon page to\nthe merged vma.  However, the upcomming move_page_tables step, which use\nset_pte_at to remap the vma2 uprobe pte to the merged vma, will overwrite\nthe newly uprobe pte in the merged vma, and lead that pte to be orphan.\n\nSince the uprobe pte will be remapped to the merged vma, we can remove the\nunnecessary uprobe_mmap upon merged vma.\n\nThis problem was first found in linux-6.6.y and also exists in the\ncommunity syzkaller:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ada39605a5e71711@google.com/T/",

If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window\nit is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some\nother CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is\nmigrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to\nwake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue\n(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the\ncurrent checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no\nlonger in the pushable tasks list.\n\nCrashes\n=======\nThis bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel\npanics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page\nfaults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all\ncoming from scheduler itself.\n\nSome of the crashes:\n-> kernel BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:1616!

This was fixed by\nevaluating the argument of the put_user() macro outside the user-enabled\nsection in commit 285a76bb2cf5 (\"riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before\nenabling user access\")\"\n\nIn order for riscv to take advantage of unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros and\nto avoid the same issue we had with put_user() and sleeping functions we\nmust ensure code flow can go through switch_to() from within a region of\ncode with SR_SUM enabled and come back with SR_SUM still enabled. This\npatch addresses the problem allowing future work to enable full use of\nunsafe_get/put_XXX() macros without needing to take a CSR bit flip cost\non every access. Make switch_to() save and restore SR_SUM.",

Given two programs each utilizing a\ncgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program\ndoing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of\nthe indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context\nthe bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the\nBPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program\nuses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the\nruntime context:\n\n  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);\n  storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];\n\n  if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)\n    ptr = &READ_ONCE(storage->buf)->data[0];\n  else\n    ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);\n\nFor the second program which was called from the originally attached\none, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former\nprogram's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can result\nin an unintended out-of-bounds access.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of\nstorage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original\nprogram if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or\nii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not\nusing any of the cgroup local storage maps.",

This makes sure we will not stall out\nthe kernel waiting for input reports during led classdev suspend. The\nstalls could happen if connectivity is unreliable or lost to the\ncontroller prior to suspend.\n\nSecond, since we lose connectivity during suspend, do not try\njoycon_init() for bluetooth controllers in the nintendo_hid_resume path.\n\nTested via multiple suspend/resume flows when using the controller both\nin USB and bluetooth modes.",

Considered\ntoo specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would\nbe a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future\nDOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].\n\n2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a\nper cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its\nchild, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a\nnetem.\n\n3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb\nto handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement\nin duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal\nnotes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this\nsafeguard.\n\n4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral\npath contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a\npacket to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem\nduplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a\nduplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/8DuRWwfqjoRDLDmBMlIfbrsZg9Gx50DHJc1ilxsEBNe2D6NMoigR_eIRIG0LOjMc3r10nUUZtArXx4oZBIdUfZQrwjcQhdinnMis_0G7VEk=@willsroot.io/\n[2] https://lwn.net/Articles/719297/",

While graceful\nshutdown normally quiesces userspace before invoking the reboot\nsyscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP VMs) can still trigger\nthis path.\n\nFix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown().\nThis marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handler\nwill skip dispatching operations to the driver.",

A kernel\nbuffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples (each of which is an\n`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are\ncopied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The\nproblem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return\ndata to userspace fill in the whole `insn->n` samples, so that there is\nan information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at\nthe time of writing.\n\nOne culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for\n`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have\na specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`\nhandler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if\n`insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn->n - 1` samples copied\nto userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.\n\nAnother culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the \"vm80xx\" driver.  It\nnever returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.\n\nFix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure\nthat uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before\nhandling each instruction.\n\nThanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix\nreplaced the call to `kmalloc_array()` with `kcalloc()`, but it is not\nalways necessary to clear the whole buffer.",

Similarly, it is used as a default\nhandler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handler\nfor `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating the\n`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed\n`INSN_BITS` instruction.  However, `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE`\ninstructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,\nindicated by the `insn->n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently\nonly handles a single sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core will\ncopy `insn->n` samples back to user-space.

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/ism: fix concurrency management in ism_cmd()\n\nThe s390x ISM device data sheet clearly states that only one\nrequest-response sequence is allowable per ISM function at any point in\ntime.  Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not\nhonor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that.\n\nThis problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states\nthat for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state\n(with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence\nconnections handled by the respective function break, and for future\nconnection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a\ndysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as\nwell.\n\nA kernel message like\n[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a\nis a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state\nwith PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like\n[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery\nis a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered\nbecause the ISM driver currently lacks support for it.\n\nOn a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to\nthe FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU\ntrying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that\nthis can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to\nPEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the\nfailure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command\nand executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs\nas if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not\nthe other one is also possible.  Frankly, I don't feel confident about\nproviding an exhaustive list of possible consequences.",

Unfortunately, is_branch_taken() isn't currently able to\nfigure this out, so the verifier walks all branches.

The\nkernel will queue a memory_failure() work which poisons the related\npage, unmaps the page, and then sends a SIGBUS to the process, so that\na system wide panic can be avoided.\n\nHowever, no memory_failure() work will be queued when abnormal\nsynchronous errors occur. These errors can include situations like\ninvalid PA, unexpected severity, no memory failure config support,\ninvalid GUID section, etc. In such a case, the user-space process will\ntrigger SEA again.  This loop can potentially exceed the platform\nfirmware threshold or even trigger a kernel hard lockup, leading to a\nsystem reboot.\n\nFix it by performing a force kill if no memory_failure() work is queued\nfor synchronous errors.\n\n[ rjw: Changelog edits ]",

This reduces the complexity of the algorithm to O(n\n log n), as done in commit d4e0340919fb (\"arm64/module: Optimize module\nload time by optimizing PLT counting\").

Suppose the\nwrite range only partially covers folio X, leaving some pages dirty.\nProcess A calls btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() when building a bio. This\nfunction call clears the TOWRITE tag of folio X, whose size = 8K and\nthe block size = 4K.

It\ncalls tag_pages_for_writeback() to tag dirty folios with\nPAGECACHE_TAG_TOWRITE. Since folio X is still dirty, it gets tagged. Then,\nB collects tagged folios using filemap_get_folios_tag() and must wait for\nfolio X to be written before returning from writepages().\n\n   0     4K    8K\n   |/////|/////|  (flag: DIRTY, tag: DIRTY|TOWRITE)\n\nHowever, between tagging and collecting, process A may call\nbtrfs_subpage_set_writeback() and clear folio X's TOWRITE tag.\n   0     4K    8K\n   |     |/////|  (flag: DIRTY|WRITEBACK, tag: DIRTY)\n\nAs a result, process B won't see folio X in its batch, and returns without\nwaiting for it. This breaks the WB_SYNC_ALL ordering requirement.\n\nFix this by using btrfs_subpage_set_writeback_keepwrite(), which retains\nthe TOWRITE tag.

Connect\n   =======\n->dwc3_thread_interrupt\n ->dwc3_ep0_interrupt\n  ->configfs_composite_setup\n   ->composite_setup\n    ->usb_ep_queue\n     ->dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue\n      ->__dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue\n       ->__dwc3_ep0_do_control_data\n        ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd\n\n2.

It maybe better to\nremove WARN_ON in all places where device endpoint commands are sent to\navoid unnecessary kernel panic due to warn.",

What am I trying to do:\n\nThis patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure\nhandling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as\ncompared to 5.10 LTS.\n\n    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space\n    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space\n\n## 2. What is the expected outcome and why\n\n- For copyin case:\n\nKernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or\ncopy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return\n-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler\nchecks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be\nrecovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code\nspecified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.\n\n- For instr case:\n\nIf a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery\nis possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills\nby reading from storage.\n\n\n## 3. What actually happens and why\n\n- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17\n\nCommit 4c132d1d844a (\"x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage\") introduced a new\nextable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the\nextable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from\nEX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS\nhandling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().\n\n- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI\n  and #MCE race\n\nWhen an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the\nCMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA\nsignature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when\nthe data is about to be consumed.\n\n### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]\n\nPrior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that\ndetected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a\nbroadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action\nOptional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because\nit's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that\nbad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE\ninterrupts and finally become an IERR.\n\nHence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub\nfrom SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to\n#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in\nuc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*\nsignature name.\n\n### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in\n    Intel platform [1]\n\nHaving decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,\nthe memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is\nexecuting asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference\nbetween a \"real\" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if\nan error is found in any read.\n\nThus:\n\n1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a\n   speculative read.\n\n2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read\n   request\n\n3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the\n   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.\n\nQuite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory\ncontroller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction\nreading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page\n(marking it as poison).\n\n\n## Why user process is killed for instr case\n\nCommit 046545a661af (\"mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported\n\"not\n---truncated---",

Existing\nmitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspace\ncan additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after a\nVMexit.\n\nSince it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,\nconditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning to\nuserspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor and\nuserspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.\n\nThis new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. For\ninstance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() to\nget an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, the\nIBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before running\nuserspace.\n\nThe intent is to integrate and optimize these cases post-embargo.\n\n[ dhansen: elaborate on suboptimal IBPB solution ]",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Try to fix random segmentation faults in package builds\n\nPA-RISC systems with PA8800 and PA8900 processors have had problems\nwith random segmentation faults for many years.  Systems with earlier\nprocessors are much more stable.\n\nSystems with PA8800 and PA8900 processors have a large L2 cache which\nneeds per page flushing for decent performance when a large range is\nflushed. The combined cache in these systems is also more sensitive to\nnon-equivalent aliases than the caches in earlier systems.\n\nThe majority of random segmentation faults that I have looked at\nappear to be memory corruption in memory allocated using mmap and\nmalloc.\n\nMy first attempt at fixing the random faults didn't work. On\nreviewing the cache code, I realized that there were two issues\nwhich the existing code didn't handle correctly. Both relate\nto cache move-in. Another issue is that the present bit in PTEs\nis racy.\n\n1) PA-RISC caches have a mind of their own and they can speculatively\nload data and instructions for a page as long as there is a entry in\nthe TLB for the page which allows move-in. TLBs are local to each\nCPU. Thus, the TLB entry for a page must be purged before flushing\nthe page. This is particularly important on SMP systems.\n\nIn some of the flush routines, the flush routine would be called\nand then the TLB entry would be purged. This was because the flush\nroutine needed the TLB entry to do the flush.\n\n2) My initial approach to trying the fix the random faults was to\ntry and use flush_cache_page_if_present for all flush operations.\nThis actually made things worse and led to a couple of hardware\nlockups. It finally dawned on me that some lines weren't being\nflushed because the pte check code was racy. This resulted in\nrandom inequivalent mappings to physical pages.\n\nThe __flush_cache_page tmpalias flush sets up its own TLB entry\nand it doesn't need the existing TLB entry. As long as we can find\nthe pte pointer for the vm page, we can get the pfn and physical\naddress of the page. We can also purge the TLB entry for the page\nbefore doing the flush. Further, __flush_cache_page uses a special\nTLB entry that inhibits cache move-in.\n\nWhen switching page mappings, we need to ensure that lines are\nremoved from the cache.  It is not sufficient to just flush the\nlines to memory as they may come back.\n\nThis made it clear that we needed to implement all the required\nflush operations using tmpalias routines. This includes flushes\nfor user and kernel pages.\n\nAfter modifying the code to use tmpalias flushes, it became clear\nthat the random segmentation faults were not fully resolved. The\nfrequency of faults was worse on systems with a 64 MB L2 (PA8900)\nand systems with more CPUs (rp4440).\n\nThe warning that I added to flush_cache_page_if_present to detect\npages that couldn't be flushed triggered frequently on some systems.\n\nHelge and I looked at the pages that couldn't be flushed and found\nthat the PTE was either cleared or for a swap page. Ignoring pages\nthat were swapped out seemed okay but pages with cleared PTEs seemed\nproblematic.\n\nI looked at routines related to pte_clear and noticed ptep_clear_flush.\nThe default implementation just flushes the TLB entry. However, it was\nobvious that on parisc we need to flush the cache page as well. If\nwe don't flush the cache page, stale lines will be left in the cache\nand cause random corruption. Once a PTE is cleared, there is no way\nto find the physical address associated with the PTE and flush the\nassociated page at a later time.\n\nI implemented an updated change with a parisc specific version of\nptep_clear_flush. It fixed the random data corruption on Helge's rp4440\nand rp3440, as well as on my c8000.\n\nAt this point, I realized that I could restore the code where we only\nflush in flush_cache_page_if_present if the page has been accessed.\nHowever, for this, we also need to flush the cache when the accessed\nbit is cleared in\n---truncated---",

The\nreason why the bucket lock is necessary is that the old_element has\nalready been stashed in htab->extra_elems after alloc_htab_elem()\nreturns. If freeing the old_element after the bucket lock is unlocked,\nthe stashed element may be reused by concurrent update procedure and the\nfreeing of old_element will run concurrently with the reuse of the\nold_element. However, the invocation of check_and_free_fields() may\nacquire a spin-lock which violates the lockdep rule because its caller\nhas already held a raw-spin-lock (bucket lock).

However, it will make the concurrent\noverwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when\nthe map is full.\n\nTherefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling\nof bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT:\n1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value\n2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to\n   cancel it again\nConsidering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try\nto acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is\nrunning, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has\ndownside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is\ndelayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable\n(e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in\nlocked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if\nnecessary.\n\nIt is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the\nproblem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the\nsoftirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced\nin v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra\ndepends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.\n\nDepends-on: v6.12+ with PREEMPT_RT enabled",

                  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: allow MDIO bus PM ops to start/stop state machine for phylink-controlled PHY\n\nDSA has 2 kinds of drivers:\n\n1. Those who call dsa_switch_suspend() and dsa_switch_resume() from\n   their device PM ops: qca8k-8xxx, bcm_sf2, microchip ksz\n2. Those who don't: all others. The above methods should be optional.\n\nFor type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -> phylink_stop(),\nand dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -> phylink_start().\nThese seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because\nthat is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the\nbiggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.\n\nTalking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which\ndo not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),\nI have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is\ntriggered:\n\n\tWARN_ON(phydev->state != PHY_HALTED && phydev->state != PHY_READY &&\n\t\tphydev->state != PHY_UP);\n\nbecause the PHY state machine is running.\n\nIt's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -> ... ->\nphylink_start() -> phy_start() having been initiated by the user.\n\nThe previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called\nphy_stop_machine(), but it didn't. So this is why the PHY is in state\nPHY_NOLINK by the time mdio_bus_phy_resume() runs.\n\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() did not call phy_stop_machine() because for\nphylink, the phydev->adjust_link function pointer is NULL. This seems a\ntechnicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 (\"phylib: fix PAL state\nmachine restart on resume\"). That commit was written before phylink\nexisted, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which\ndon't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY.\nBut phylink itself has historically not been developed with\nsuspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that\nscenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long. Plus, prior\nto the WARN_ON(), it would have likely been invisible.\n\nThis issue is not in fact restricted to type 2 DSA drivers (according to\nthe above ad-hoc classification), but can be extrapolated to any MAC\ndriver with phylink and MDIO-bus-managed PHY PM ops. DSA is just where\nthe issue was reported. Assuming mac_managed_pm is set correctly, a\nquick search indicates the following other drivers might be affected:\n\n$ grep -Zlr PHYLINK_NETDEV drivers/ | xargs -0 grep -L mac_managed_pm\ndrivers/net/ethernet/atheros/ag71xx.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/sparx5/sparx5_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan966x/lan966x_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa2/dpaa2-mac.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fs_enet/fs_enet-main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa/dpaa_eth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/ucc_geth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/enetc/enetc_pf_common.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvpp2/mvpp2_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvneta.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/prestera/prestera_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mediatek/mtk_eth_soc.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/altera/altera_tse_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/wangxun/txgbe/txgbe_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/meta/fbnic/fbnic_phylink.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/tehuti/tn40_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mscc/ocelot_net.c\n\nMake the existing conditions dependent on the PHY device having a\nphydev->phy_link_change() implementation equal to the default\nphy_link_change() provided by phylib. Otherwise, we implicitly know that\nthe phydev has the phylink-provided phylink_phy_change() callback, and\nwhen phylink is used, the PHY state machine always needs to be stopped/\nstarted on the suspend/resume path. The code is structured as such that\nif phydev->phy_link_change() is absent, it is a matter of time until the\nkernel will crash - no need to further complicate the test.\n\nThus, for the situation where the PM is not managed b\n---truncated---",

Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel).

When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead.
